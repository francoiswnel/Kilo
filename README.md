# Kilo
My implementation of the [kilo text editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) created by [antirez](https://github.com/antirez). The code is from [Jeremy Ruten's guide](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/), but written and restructured according to my preferences, with my own comments added.

# Build
Clone the repo and run `make`.
